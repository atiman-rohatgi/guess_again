#project guess_again_game

objective: this is just a simple guessing game, but this time around I have used prolog as the language to build this.

functionality

          -the program generates a random number which it does not show to the user.
          
          -then it asks the user to guess that number and tells whether to guess higher or lower.

          -the range of the number for this game is (1-10).
          
language: prolog
